        "There are different types of data in Python, namely:\n",
        "* Integers (int) : whole numbers like 5, -10, or 0\n",
        "* Floats (float) : numbers with decimals like 3.14 or -0.5\n",
        "* Booleans (bool) : true or false values (True or False)\n",
        "* Strings (str) : text or words inside quotes, like \"Hello\" or 'Python'\n",
        "* Lists (list) : ordered collections of items, like [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "* Tuples (tuple) : ordered, unchangeable collections, like (4, 5, 6)\n",
        "* Sets (set) : unordered collections with no duplicates, like {1, 2, 3}\n",
        "* Dictionaries (dict) : collections of key-value pairs, like {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",

        "In the subsequent sections, we will delve deeper into each type of data, exploring their definitions, examples, and how to use them in Python code."
